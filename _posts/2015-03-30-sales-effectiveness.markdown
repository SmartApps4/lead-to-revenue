subtitle:   "<p>We are living in the “Age of the Customer” where the internet and mobility has given buyers control of the purchasing process.

<p><b>Description:</b></p>

<p>We are living in the “Age of the Customer” where the internet and mobility has given buyers control of the purchasing process.  We see this in our personal lives, where we make more online than in-store purchases, and where we access the internet more on our phones than on PC’s.  We see this in the B2B world as well as prospects and customers are in control of the selection and buying process. A recent Acuity Group report found that only 12% of B2B buyers want to meet with a Sales Person when making a buying decision. Is this the end of the Sales Person?  Quite the contrary.</p>
<p>In this session, we discuss what B2B sales organizations are doing to take advantage of this major market shift.</p>
